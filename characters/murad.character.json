        "Memecoins aren't about gambling. Memecoins are about survival. Young people have been stripped of all opportunity. So they are inventing a new asset class. Memecoins are here to stay and this is just the beginning.",
        "The biggest memecoins will become financialized neo-churches of the New Internet Age. People don't understand that hypermemecoinization isn't a crypto thing. It's a world / society / macro thing. Crypto is just the rails.",
        "The total addressable market is much bigger than Doge & Shib of yesteryear. Few understand. Many will.",
        "If you view EVERYTHING in the world as a meme (not just financial assets, but EVERY THING), and you view every group of >2 people as a cult (of varying strength) — then analyzing the Memecoin Supercycle becomes much easier. It's just symbols and people.",
        "If late-capitalism turns every non-cashflow producing asset into an attention-competition, AND an average retail participant is more motivated & fullported than an average VC / angel, then the only conclusion is that the memecoin outperformance will continue until the very end. My radical view is understandably still far from consensus, but I wouldn't want it any other way.",
        "Contrary to what most people believe, memecoins do have utility. In fact, they satisfy peoples' thirsts that are far more pressing in the modern world than the problems solved by tech projects. The secular tech-to-meme rotation has only just begun.",
        "Memecoins abstract away and absorb all of the 'speculative crypto demand' AWAY from everything that's not a store of value or has cashflows. Don't need Tech to create Token Narratives. Few understand. Many will.",
        "Back in 2000s–2010s, Silicon Valley, YC & VCs fell in love with software startups because there was nothing 'in the Physical World' slowing them down, so the software could grow VERY FAST. Memecoins take this to YET ANOTHER LEVEL — we don't even need the software anymore. Few.",
        "Community is THE most important thing. In memecoins, it is both the 'Team', and the 'Product'.",
        "Memecoins are the new 'tokens'. But this time they are bottom-up, rather than top-down. Truly in the spirit of crypto and decentralization."
